plot_title_player,{0}「{1}」
plot_content_1,Stop it! Don't shout! Only I can hear your voice here. I have been waiting for hundreds of years. I have finally waited for you...
plot_content_2,"Who are you? How come I can’t see you? Are you a human,or a ghost?"
plot_content_3,"Humph! Of course I am human! Forget it, I will not be the same as you juniors.\\nI am <TDName>[Tiansheng Lao]</>, you call me <TDName>[Tian Lao]</>.\\n You can hear my voice because my <TDName>[Chuan Yin Ru Mi]</> has been achieved. It is not difficult to convey sound to you in this place."
plot_content_4,<TDName>[Tian]</>...<TDName>[Lao]</>? What is this place? Where are you hiding??
plot_content_5,"I have traveled all over the world for hundreds of years. I have countless enemies under my hands. If our relationship is known in advance, I'm afraid I'll have to wait for hundreds of years again?\\nYou only need to know that this place is called <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</>, which is where you and I are trapped. The most important thing now is that you need to strengthen your strength as soon as possible to take the position of <TDName>[Wulin Alliance Lord]</>. I'll tell you how to help me get rid of trouble when the time comes. "
plot_content_6,"Of course, I will not let you suffer losses. All the martial arts in this <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</> are what I have learned. You have my mark, so as long as you learn it quickly, you can master it.\\nThis <TDName>[Tian Shu Bao Dian]</> you accept it first. When you encounter difficulties, I will solve them by myself. I just hope that you can achieve hegemony as soon as possible. This is a win-win situation for you and me."
plot_content_7,<TDName>[Tian Shu Bao Dian]</> is the crystallization of my heart and mind. Its content will gradually emerge as you gain experience.
plot_content_8,"It seems that this can only be the case, but how come this <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</> is so small?"
plot_content_9,"Small? \\n......\\nForget it, it seems that too much time has passed and you have forgotten your instinct. Boy, you need to remember: as <TDName>[Geng Fu]</>, when your strength recovers, you will naturally understand many mysteries in this world."
plot_content_10,So what should I do now?
plot_content_11,............\\nIt seems that you really forgot a lot. I still have a little time to help you for the time being.\\nEach plot in this <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</> has a <TDName>[Regional Experience]</>. Complete the experience of this plot first.
plot_content_101,"Very good! Your skills and wisdom are much better than I imagined! \\nFollow this step, and there is hope for me to get rid of trouble when the time comes! Hahaha."
plot_content_102,What should I do next?
plot_content_103,"Open the <TDName>[Fei Ge Chuan Shu]</>, and you will naturally see how to develop the <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</>. Each area of <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</> has unique resources.\\nMake good use of these resources to accelerate your growth. However, the hearts of people in the rivers and lakes are complicated, and you should be careful to deal with them in your daily life.\\nIn addition, if you have a lot of money, you can also find <TDName>[merchant ships]</> to develop new plots."
plot_content_104,Uh...I got it.
plot_content_201,Stop! Don't go further into the open sea! This is very dangerous!
plot_content_202,What’s out there in the sea? !!
plot_content_203,Why? Looks calm enough to me.
plot_content_204,"Go back first, the time is not ripe yet! I will tell you everything when the time comes!"
plot_content_205,I need to see for myself what is out there.
plot_content_206,"Ah, it's good for young people to suffer a little."
plot_content_301,"As the world expands, the forces of <TDName>[Da Huang Jie]</> will also increase. Without enough strength, it is impossible to deal with a more complex environment in the rivers and lakes. The top priority is to first join a sect to accumulate strength, and then gradually plot the throne of <TDName>[Wulin Alliance Lord]</>."
plot_content_302,How can I join a sect?
plot_content_303,The <TDName>[Bulletin Board]</> outside each sect's mountain gate will write the requirements for accepting disciples. You can go there to see if you meet the requirements.
plot_content_304,Got it.
plot_content_401,"Please note! New expanded plots will appear as <TDName>[bandits]</>. They are all defeated people in the rivers and lakes. Eliminating them can gain fame in the rivers and lakes. But remember to demolish their huts and cages, otherwise there will still be villains coming here to make trouble."
plot_content_402,What if I’m no match for them?
plot_content_403,"Hire bodyguards and set traps. Sometimes avoiding the edge is also a good choice. Wait until your strength is strong or you have built your own power, and ordinary bandits will not be feared."
plot_content_404,Got it.
plot_content_1000,What else do you want to know about?
plot_content_1001,How can I join a sect?

plot_content_1007,How to treat hidden diseases?
plot_content_1008,"For minor injuries, self-gasification can be used for treatment. If the injury is too serious, you can only go to the infirmary for treatment, but their charges are quite expensive..."
plot_content_1009,How to make money?
plot_content_1010,"Trading, helping others complete commission tasks, or doing odd jobs in major stores. However, no matter how, it is not as fast as doing extraordinary things, haha, without night grass horses will not grow fat!"
plot_content_1011,How can you be invincible in the world?
plot_content_1012,"Hehehe~ There is no real invincibility in this world~ You can improve your strength by collecting secret skills, inner strength, abilities and equipment, but only by combining them properly can you truly become powerful."

plot_content_1028,"Execute more sect orders, or submit materials to the warehouse."
plot_content_1029,What do you do in the practice room?

plot_content_1031,What do you do in the warehouse?

My ideal is to run a good tavern and provide customers with a comfortable environment."
plot_content_1037,What do you do in the stables?
plot_content_1038,"I make money by selling horses in [horse stalls] and post stations. There are also some treasures I have collected in the counter, and some miscellaneous goods are sold in the sundry cabinet. If there is no important business, I will usually stay here."
plot_content_1039,Do you know what animals like to eat?
plot_content_1040,"I only know some: [horses] like to eat mixed grass, [eagles] like to eat meat chunks, [monkeys] like to eat pine nuts and plums, [snakes] and [martens] like to eat meat chunks and eggs, and [chickens] like Eat all kinds of insects."
plot_content_1041,What do you do in the blacksmith shop?
plot_content_1042,"I make money by selling forged weapons and hidden weapons on the [weapon rack]. If I have enough materials, I will make weapons.

plot_content_1050,"I make money by treating patients on the [sickbed] and selling elixir on the [medicine rack]. When I have nothing to do, I will practice alchemy and cultivate my body. Those in the martial arts world come to see a doctor, I never ask for names and origins, as long as I can treat, I will do my best. This is also the foundation of my medical ethics."
plot_content_10491,I need treatment
plot_content_10501,"Lie down on the sickbed quickly, and I will come to see your symptoms."
